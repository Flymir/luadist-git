LuaDist-git is Lua module deployment utility for the LuaDist project [1].

In fact it's another version of luadist utility [2], rewritten from scratch.


The main goals
--------------

 * access git repositories directly and get rid of unnecessary
   dependencies (i.e. luasocket, luasec, md5, openssl, unzip)

 * add functionality for uploading binary versions of modules to repositories
